          <p>I'm a self driven designer that's passionate about creating responsive web experiences that are user centered with a strong brand identity.

            <p>Outside my 9-5 you can find me at one of the city's live music venues headbanging to some heavy metal, at home curled up with a book and one of my cats, or at some obscure art show admiring other's bold creativity.</p>
