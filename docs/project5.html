      <h2 class="text-secondary">Overview</h2>
      <p><a href="http://sharing-the-6ix.herokuapp.com/" class="text-secondary" target="blank">Sharing the 6ix</a> is an
        app created in Ruby on Rails for my final project at Bitmaker's Full Stack Immersive Web Development course. I
        worked with two other web dev students for this assignment, and the goal was to create any type of web app our
        group wanted.</p>
      <h2 class="text-secondary">The Problem</h2>
      <p>The idea behind the project was to create a goods sharing network where users can lend out or borrow tools,
        equipment or appliances from other users in their Toronto neighbourhood (or surrounding), reducing the need to
        buy "one time use" items - and to create a sense of community. Sharing is caring!</p>
      <h2 class="text-secondary">The Process</h2>
      <p>During the early stages of the project planning, we created user stories, user flow mockups, and model
        structure to flesh out our ideas. You can find these (and everything else) on ourÂ <a
          href="https://github.com/dmitrysbn/sharing-the-6ix" class="text-secondary" target="blank">Sharing the 6ix -
          Github Repo.</a> Of course we did face some challenges on the way, but we kept organized with our <a
          href="https://github.com/dmitrysbn/sharing-the-6ix/projects/1" target="blank">Github Project Planner,</a>
        where we added daily tasks, bugs & other items in order of prioritization. Below are some whiteboard images
        demonstrating our planning for the database structure, user flow and UI design.</p>

        <div class="grid">
          <div class="cell">
            <img src="img/projects/sharing-the-six-database-structure.png" class="responsive-image" />
          </div>
          <div class="cell">
            <img src="img/projects/sharing-the-six-user-flow.jpg" class="responsive-image" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2 class="text-secondary">The Solution</h2>
      <p>Once we fleshed out our ideas on the whiteboard, I made an <a href="https://invis.io/W6HTE1Z497G"
          class="text-secondary" target="blank">InVision prototype</a> to plan out the UI design. My main role in this
        project was handling the front end development (styling in SaSS, but we each took turns pair programming while
        building the database schema, models and controllers. We completed the project within 10 days and presented a
        demo to an audience of two other Bitmaker cohorts and all our instructors. <br>While being one of my most
        challenging projects I've tackled, I learned so much within such a short period of time. I improved my coding,
        project planning and designing all within less than 2 weeks.</p>
