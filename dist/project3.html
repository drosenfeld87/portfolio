            <h2 class="text-secondary">Overview</h2>
              <p>In April 2019, I attended HackerYou's part time UI/UX program to gain more experience in app design and improve my UI design skills. For our final project, the class was given a massive problem to solve for - transportation in the city of Toronto.</p>
            <h2 class="text-secondary">The Problem</h2>
              <p>We all love to hate on TTC, pedestrians, cyclists and the drivers of Toronto (seems to be whichever group we happen to not be participating in that particular day!). Henceforth all the issues this discussion arises. For my project, I chose to focus on one of the main roadblocks (pun intended!) that every method of transportation faces: the roads and their dangerous potholes</p>
            <h2 class="text-secondary">The Process</h2>
              <p>When I first started jotting down my ideas and how might we's, I discovered that this problem was much bigger than I anticipated. After discussing with other students & instructors, I chose to narrow down my problem to one transportation method</p>

              <p>After sketching out my storyboard, it was user interview time. I hit the streets and talked to everyone I saw with a bike, then later on, interviewed my friends to get their input. Here are some notes on my interview question results.</p>

            <h2 class="text-secondary">The Solution</h2>
              <p>We eventually came to a final design, and added the blog banner as a tie in for added beneficial info for SMBs. I am currently working with our front end team to create more real estate for this page throughout our site to increase vilibility and click throughs to customer sign up.</p>
