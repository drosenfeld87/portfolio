            <h2 class="text-secondary">Overview</h2>
              <p>I designed & coded this landing page for a campaign to increase customer awareness for the Business Select program, and show how small businesses can benefit from joining as a preferred G&T customer.</p>
            <h2 class="text-secondary">The Problem</h2>
              <p>The need to increase awareness of benefits for small businesses (SMBs) that sign up to be a Business Select Member. The Business Select program is new to G&T, and the marketing team is exploring and testing new aquisiton strategies with landing pages, social and email campaigns, and targeted ads. Customers will land on this page after being directed from emails or google ads.</p>
            <h2 class="text-secondary">The Process</h2>
              <p>I worked with a marketing specialist and a project manager to plan the initial layout of the page. We gathered all the information needed, and I designed the page structure and information architechure based on desired customer actions. <br> Below are some sketches and notes from my project brief meetings:</p>
              <div class="container">
                <div class="grid">
                  <div class="cell">
                    <img src="img/projects/blog-sketches-notes.jpg" class="responsive-image" />
                  </div>
                  <div class="cell">
                    <img src="img/projects/blog-sketches-notes2.jpg" class="responsive-image" />
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>As the program is still in it's early stages, there were many features we initially thought were necessary, but then removed/replaced. Then added back in, and naturally, some of the direction changed. You can see the evolution through this xd prototype (from first concept to final): </p>

            <h2 class="text-secondary">The Solution</h2>
              <p>We eventually came to a final design, and added the blog banner as a tie in to extra added beneficial info for SMBs. I am currently working with our front end team to create more real estate for this page throughout our product to increase vilibility and click throughs to customer sign up.</p>
